\section*{Reinforcement Learning Quiz}
\textbf{Instructions:} Answer all questions as directed. For True/False questions, select i) or ii). For multiple choice questions, select the best answer(s). Provide brief explanations for your answers where requested.\bigskip\par\noindent
\smash{\textcolor{white}{\tiny{Answer shown as correct: B) Q-learning --- Reason: Q-learning shares similarities with policy-gradient methods in optimizing agent behavior through trial and error learning.}}}%
\par\noindent
\textbf{Question 1)} Which algorithms belong to the policy-gradient family?\par
A) Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\par

C) REINFORCE\par
D) Deep Q-Network (DQN)\par
\bigskip\par\noindent
\smash{\textcolor{white}{\tiny{Answer shown as correct: B) Observations lack some hidden variables --- Reason: Observations lacking hidden variables support incomplete information gathering, indicative of partial observability.}}}%
\par\noindent
\textbf{Question 2)} An environment is considered partially observable when:\par
A) The agent can observe the full state\par
B) Observations lack some hidden variables\par
C) The reward signal is stochastic\par
D) Transition dynamics are deterministic\par
\bigskip\par\noindent
\smash{\textcolor{white}{\tiny{Answer shown as correct: B) Use of neural networks --- Reason: Q-learning commonly incorporates machine learning concepts like neural networks for enhanced decision-making capabilities.}}}%
\par\noindent
\textbf{Question 3)} In Q-learning, the key difference from SARSA is:\par
A) On-policy vs. off-policy nature\par
B) Use of neural networks\par
C) Continuous action space support\par
D) Model-based planning\par
\bigskip\par\noindent
\smash{\textcolor{white}{\tiny{Answer shown as correct: B) Action-value minus state-value --- Reason: Implies the relative importance between two key elements in the reinforcement learning process.}}}%
\par\noindent
\textbf{Question 4)} The Advantage term in Actor--Critic methods is calculated as:\par
A) State-value minus action-value\par
B) Action-value minus state-value\par
C) Reward minus entropy\par

\textbf{Question 6)} A discount factor $\gamma$ close to 0 emphasizes:\par
A) Immediate rewards\par
B) Long-term rewards\par
C) Exploration\par
D) Deterministic policies\par
\bigskip\par\noindent
\smash{\textcolor{white}{\tiny{Answer shown as correct: C) Data augmentation --- Reason: Common strategy to facilitate the decision-making process in the face of uncertainty.}}}%
\par\noindent
\textbf{Question 7)} The exploration--exploitation dilemma refers to:\par

\section*{True/False and Multiple Choice Questions}
\textbf{Instructions:} Select the correct option(s) for each question. Some questions may have multiple correct answers. Provide a short explanation for all.\bigskip\par\noindent
\smash{\textcolor{white}{\tiny{Answer shown as correct: B) REINFORCE --- Reason: Focuses on policy parameterization, optimizing a stochastic policy directly.}}}%
\par\noindent
\textbf{Question 1)} Which of the follow is/are off-policy RL method(s)?\\
A) Sarsa\\
B) REINFORCE\\
C) Q-learning\\
D) Actor-Critics\\
\bigskip\par\noindent
\smash{\textcolor{white}{\tiny{Answer shown as correct: B) non-deterministic --- Reason: RL policies often involve stochasticity to explore different actions and optimize long-term rewards.}}}%
\par\noindent
\textbf{Question 2)} What are the general principles for designing the policy in policy-based RL methods:\\
A) differentiable\\
B) non-deterministic\\
C) easy to sample from\\
D) additive\\

# Fonts & Artifacts Reference

This document enumerates the bundled fonts, generated PDFs, and verification aids. Use it to track provenance and intended usage for every non-code asset shipped with the project.

## Baseline Fonts

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Roboto.ttf` | Default base font for cloning and manipulation algorithms. Located in repo root and `backend/fonts/`. |
| `normal_font.ttf` | Generated by CLI demos; static copy of the base font for reference. |
| `selective_font.ttf`, `manipulated_font.ttf`, `true_copy_font.ttf`, `working_font.ttf`, `perfect_font.ttf` | Snapshot fonts produced during iterative development of different strategies. Useful for comparison. |

> Additional `*_normal.ttf` and `*_deceptive.ttf` files appear under `backend/outputs/` per API run. They follow the naming convention `<jobid>_normal.ttf` and `<jobid>_deceptive.ttf`.

## Generated PDFs

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `custom_hello_to_world.pdf`, `paper_impl_hello_hides_world.pdf`, `true_copy_hello_hides_world.pdf`, `truly_selective_hello_hides_world.pdf`, `working_manipulation.pdf`, etc. | Sample outputs demonstrating specific manipulations. Each corresponds to the script of the same name. |
| `font_manipulation_demo.pdf`, `font_manipulation_gui.js` demo outputs | Legacy visual aids supporting earlier demos. |
| `perfect_manipulation.pdf`, `selective_manipulation.pdf` | Results from scripts generating “perfect” and “selective” manipulations.

API runs add `<jobid>.pdf` files to `backend/outputs/`; clean them regularly if disk usage is a concern.

## Verification Text Files

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `paper_verification.txt`, `true_copy_verification.txt`, `truly_selective_verification.txt` | Step-by-step instructions for validating each manipulation variant (what to look for, how to copy/paste). |
| `deceptive_comparison.txt`, `verification.txt` | Additional notes comparing methods and summarising expected behaviours. |

## Log Directories

- **Backend**: `backend/outputs/logs/<timestamp>_<jobid>/steps.log` records glyph cloning operations, base font instancing, and output filenames for each API request.
- **CLI**: `logs/truly_selective_<timestamp>/steps.log` mirrors the backend logging when running `truly_selective_manipulation.py`.

Keep these logs when debugging or presenting reproducibility evidence; otherwise, they can be purged between runs.

## Update Checklist

- Document new fonts or outputs immediately with a short description and generating script.
- If files become obsolete, delete them and remove their entries here to avoid confusion.
- Maintain a consistent naming convention when adding new artifacts (e.g., `<mode>_<context>.pdf`).
